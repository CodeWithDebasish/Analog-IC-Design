## 2. High-Pass Filter Circuit

This section explains the working and transfer function of a high-pass filter using an op-amp.

### 🔎 Circuit Overview

- `C_i = 4.7 μF` (blocks DC)  
- `R_i = R_f = 5kΩ` (sets gain & time constant)  
- Op-Amp in **non-inverting** mode

### 🧮 Transfer Function


H(s) = (Rf * s * Ci) / (1 + s * Ri * Ci)


- At low freq → attenuation  
- At high freq → gain = 1

### 🔻 Cutoff Frequency

fc = 1 / (2πRiCi)
≈ 6.77 Hz
